## How to reproduce the results?
- Firstly, the Conda environment that was used for the analysis is provided as a .yaml file ('neonatal_EEG_analysis_env'). Uploading this environment in Anaconda Navigator will take care of necessary libraries/dependencies required for the analysis. After accessing the environment one can execute the Experiments 1-3.
